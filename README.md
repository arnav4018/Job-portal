  userId       String
  title        String
  data         String   // JSON string of resume data
  pdfUrl       String?  // S3 URL for PDF
  isDefault    Boolean  @default(false)
  downloadCount Int     @default(0)
  createdAt    DateTime @default(now())

}

// Resume Data Structure
interface ResumeContent {

    summary?: string
  }
  experience: Array<{

    gpa?: string
  }>

```

### AI Matching Algorithm
```typescript
// Multi-factor scoring system
export function calculateJobMatch(candidateSkills: string[], jobSkills: string[]): number {
  const skillMatch = calculateSkillMatch(candidateSkills, jobSkills)
  const experienceMatch = calculateExperienceMatch(candidate, job)
  const locationMatch = calculateLocationMatch(candidate, job)
  const salaryMatch = calculateSalaryMatch(candidate, job)
  
  return (skillMatch * 0.4) + (experienceMatch * 0.25) + 
         (locationMatch * 0.2) + (salaryMatch * 0.15)
}

// Skill matching with fuzzy logic
function calculateSkillMatch(candidateSkills: string[], jobSkills: string[]): number {
  let totalScore = 0
  let maxPossibleScore = jobSkills.length * 100
  
  for (const jobSkill of jobSkills) {
    const bestMatch = findBestSkillMatch(jobSkill, candidateSkills)
    totalScore += bestMatch.score
  }
  
  return (totalScore / maxPossibleScore) * 100
}
```

### Smart Search Implementation
```typescript
// Enhanced job search with AI scoring
export async function searchJobsWithAI(params: SearchParams, userSkills: string[]) {
  const jobs = await prisma.job.findMany({
    where: buildSearchFilters(params),
    include: { company: true, applications: true }
  })
  
  // Calculate match scores for each job
  const jobsWithScores = jobs.map(job => ({
    ...job,
    matchScore: calculateJobMatch(userSkills, parseJobSkills(job.skills)),
    skillGaps: identifySkillGaps(userSkills, parseJobSkills(job.skills))
  }))
  
  // Sort by relevance and match score
  return jobsWithScores.sort((a, b) => b.matchScore - a.matchScore)
}
```
